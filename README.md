# Vuex Shopping Cart

In this project I will learn all there is to know about Vuex by creating a shopping cart from scratch.

I will start by creating a shopping cart with Vue and then progressively dive into Vuex features as needed. Piece by piece I will replace parts of the application with mutations, getters and actions.

I think I will also have to break the Vuex store into modules.

After this project, I should know when and how to use getters, mutations, actions and how to split a Store with modules.
